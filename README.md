Instructions

Decision Making (if-else and switch): ( choose at least 2 tasks from below)
Leap Year Checker: Create a function that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

Ticket Pricing: Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and then determines the price of a movie ticket based on the following criteria:

Children (age <= 12): $10
Teenagers (age 13-17): $15
Adults (age >= 18): $20
Weather Clothing Adviser: Develop a program that asks the user for the current temperature and whether it is raining or not. Based on this information, advise the user on what clothing to wear.

Recursion: ( choose at least 2 tasks from below)
Fibonacci Sequence: Implement a recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).

Palindrome Checker: Create a recursive function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Power Function: Write a recursive function to calculate the result of raising a number to a given power.
